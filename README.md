# Challenge : Gatekeeper Middleware

The app has a single endpoint, /api/users/me. This endpoint is similar to Thinkful's [whoami](accounts.thinkful.com/admin/whoami) endpoint, which sends back a JSON object representing the authenticated user. 

Passport.js is a popular library for adding authentication to Node apps. Working through this challenge prepares for thinking about authentication in addition to practicing implementation of middleware in Express apps.
